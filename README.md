## Project_03

Welcome to my first project Brainster Labs. This is my project which was so challenging for me to use Java Script before we start to study about it.

## Description

In this project there is a index page and form page. In the index page, first of all is a navigation bar with links of different academy. After that is a banner with a background picture. The next section is a filter section where you can filter all cards (where i used Java Script for filtering). Moving down the filters there is a card section where are included all cards. In this section i have used Java Script to make pagination button to load more card on mobile devices. And in the end there is a footer.
In the next page whis is a form page, there is a navigation bar as well. And there is a form to be fill out. For this form i used Java Script to make validation on the form.

## Stapes taken to upload on Gitlab

First of all I clone my main branch of Brainster projects into my local computer with comand git clone and paste the https link from Github. After that from main branch I created a new branch and name it as Project_01 with comand git checkout -b plus the name of the new branch.
As soon as i created my new branch I add my starter files( index.html, stle.css and images folder) and i added to the staging area with comand add . added them in the .git repo with comand git commit -m "Added starter files". After that i create a new branches for each section from Project_01 with coman git checkout -b plus the name of the new branch same as a section and i was merging every single branch to Project_01 in Gitlab with merge request, aprove the merge request and merge. As soon as i merge the new branch to Project_01 i took all changes localy with comand git pull origin Project_01.
As soon as i was finishing my section in the project i was adding them and commiting them and When i finish all my changes i push them in GitLab with command git push.

## Working with Terminal

While i was uploading my challenge i used a terminal in vs code to add my files and make a changes.

## Github Setup:

Create an accound in Github;
Config username and email in your terminal, with comand git config –global user.email “” ; git config –global user.name “ ”;
Create a new project in Github with project name and initialize repository with README;
Create a folder where you want to store your local repository and open in terminal.
Clone the Github project locally with comand git clone (https link from Github project);
Create new branch and switch to the new branch with comand git checkout -b (name of the branch);
Add starter files with comand touch (name of the file);
Add them to staging area with git add . ;
Commit all of yours changes with comand git commit -m " enter your message";
Once you have commited you changes, push them to Gitlab with comand git push origin (name of the branch);
